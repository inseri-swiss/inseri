## Comment app
The Comment App allows the user to make commentaries that are different in nature from the options, provided for example by the "application description". This difference primarily consists in the fact that Comment App is linked to a particular query and its elements.

For example, let us open any template, go to random page of the provided resource and make a comment.
For that, from the Inseri Logo, we open a list of application, and in the group "Add, Edit and Manage data", we click on a "Comment App".

In the opened frame of "Comment App", in the field "New Comment", we can directly enter our comment. Clicking on "Add comment", will add it to the list of all comments listed below.

To add another comment, navigate to the page of the resource to which your new comment should belong, type your comment as before and click on "Add comment".

You can thus annotate he whole book, for example, type in all useful citations from a book found on Archive.org, or make bookmarks in a long manuscript resource.

If you need to change the comment, click on the logo to the left of your comment, which is empty by defolt, but where you can have a profile picture.

It will open 2 options: "Edit comment" and "Delete comment". The comments are saved when you click on Inseri logo, all like other apps.

In order to find your commentaries, go to your Dashboard, and in the top menu instead of projects select commentaries.

You will be able to see all your commentaries, and when you click on any of them, it will open a corresponding project page, and a corresponding page of ressource.

As in this case your commentary is attached to a particular resource via query, it will dissapear if you modify the query.

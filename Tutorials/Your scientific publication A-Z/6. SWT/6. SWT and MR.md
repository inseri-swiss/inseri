Inseri integrates the Semantic Web Technology with ease.
This part is being implemented in 2020, and already now the user can visualise an ontology created externally with a SparqlVisualiser.

For that, the user should open in Inseri the App, that is located in Webapplication department.

Then, the only thing that is needed is a URL of the "raw" ontology.
The example below will allow to visualize an ontology of the "Drawings of Gods" research project.

Please select ontology.ttl

Then click on "Raw" display option, and copy the URL.

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaDHUL/drawings-gods/master/drawings-gods-ontology.ttl](https://github.com/LaDHUL/drawings-gods)

Paste the URL in the URL box in SparqlVisualisation in Inseri and enjoy the dynamic view of the ontology.

The export and saving options are now under development.

Machine Reasoning sessions can soon be accessed via the microservices.

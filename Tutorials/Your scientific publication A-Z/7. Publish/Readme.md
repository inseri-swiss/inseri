# 7. Publish
## 7.1. Publish your project webpage

We shall now explain how to connect the already made collages into a webpage with navigation and how to publish it with various options.

### 7.1.1. Preediting each page
First of all, the user should decide how each page already created should look like, that is if the Inseri button, or application control frames should be visible or not, shall the user see only a resulting representation from an app, or also an app itself or not.

In order to remove an app from a collage one should click on the title, where there is an option "minimize".

One will only see a tiny sign of application under Inseri button:

By clicking on this sign one gets to the option "Remove application", without removing the created data.

By this method one can remove the text editor, but leave the text view app with the text created by the text editor.

### 7.1.2. Arranging pages by order
Second, the user should decide how many pages and in which order the webpage shall have in total.
From the page which is to be the first, the user should click on the name of this page, and select "add new page" if the following one is not yet ready, or "link" the page, if one has already created it.

"Link" will open the Inseri page storage, where the user can select other pages that have already been created.

As soon as you click on the "+" sign, the next page becomes linked and you can navigate between with the help of "<" and ">" signs.

Now, suppose you would like to set the pages in a different order. For that one should click on Dashboard in the top right corner, select the first page of the project and click on "Go to document Index":

The following frame will open:

Here, with the help of provided buttons, one can easy move the pages up and down by order or delete them.

### 7.1.3. Publishing options

The publishing options can be accessed from the top right corner via this button:

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/7.%20Publish/7A8.png" alt="Publish button" width="200"></p>

The publishing options will appear in the down left corner, and one can chose if to make visible or not the Inseri button, the applications options, and data browser. One can also go for "test" and "permanent" publishing options.

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/7.%20Publish/7A9.png" alt="Publish options 1" width="200"></p>

Once the "Publish" button is clicked, the page goes publish and can be accessed via its URL. A small sign of the globe will appear in the top right corner demonstrating that it is public.

To make the page private again, one should open the publish option as explained above, and insted of "publish" button, one will find there "make private again":

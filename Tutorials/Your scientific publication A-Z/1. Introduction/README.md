# Introduction

In the end of this tutorial, the user will have and idea about the workflow areas in INSERI.

<p>This is a collection of tutorials that will allow the scholar to start and successfully finish their academic project from A to Z within INSERI framework.</p>

<p>The whole workflow is divided into 7 distinct areas, as below. The project might need all 7 or only a few. These areas conceived in such a way as to cover the totality of the academic work, from raw data collection to analysis, and, finally, to publication. The framework should be sufficient for the scholar to have all the project data in a single place, and to need no other applications to be able to complete the project.</p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Add&quot;</strong> part covers the workflow from the raw data upload, via adding metadata, managing bibliography, to the formulation of hypothesis and methods. Some parts are already stable in INSERI, others are under development.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Admin&quot;</strong> part covers various aspects of administering the project, it is UNDER DEVELOPMENT, and will include such tools as adding users, project planning, a selection of online communication tools, etc.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Enrich&quot;</strong> part essecially covers various kids of TEI/XML tagging and annotation of the raw data, which becomes transformed into texts and numbers. The information is saved as triples.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Analyse&quot;</strong> block consists of various tools made for human and computer-assisted analysis, such as the comparison of two or more images, text versions comparison, finding textual parallels, colliding variants in a view to produce a diplomatic/critical edition.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Visual&quot;</strong> part is already well-developed in INSERI, which has not less than 8 different visualization applications, all of them can directly reuse the RDF data created at the previous steps.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;SWT&quot;</strong> part stands for &quot;Semantic Web Technology&quot;, and this module offers the scholars the possibility to formulate very complex queries, that are beyond the capacities provided by complex search queries in relational databases, for example.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>&quot;Publish&quot;</strong> area provides various options for generating the output that can be immediately used for producing online or print books and articles.</li>

<h1 id="toc_0">Step 0.1: Login, setting up project "space", creating project title and a short description.</h1>

<h2>Login</h2>
<p>The users can already create their project page in INSERI, describe it, obtain and change the access information, as well as add the texts, tables, and pictures. </p>

<p>To get started, one should access INSERI here:
<a href="http://test-nieos.nie-ine.ch/home">Inseri Test Version</a>
[Inseri Prod Version] Only prod version allows creating an account.</p>

<p>By clicking on the lighthouse image in the top left corner, one opens a list of applications, as below.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/2.png" alt="Applications, state 2020.03.24" width="600"></p>

<p>Clicking on "Log in" in Inseri Test version opens the login form, which is here:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/3.png" alt="Login, state 2020.03.24" width="300"></p>

<h2>Setting up project "space"</h2>
<p>Having logged in, first of all, the user should create a &quot;project space&quot;. For that, in the Dashboard, which opens in INSERI from the top right-hand corner, and, in order to do this, one should click on the green button, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/4.png" alt="Create New" width="200"></p>

<p>It will open a frame for creating a new &quot;Collage&quot;, which the user should imagine as a separate webpage, which will contain multiple elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5.png" alt="Collage creation" width="400"></p>

<p>The information set in here won&#39;t be visible to public, but only to the creator and the members of the groups that are set (more on groupd in the Admin section below). What is being created here is a &quot;storage&quot; that will contain finished and unfinished parts of the online project, that are not visible to public until they are &quot;published&quot;. 
Another important point, is that there often (but not always) 2 applications for entering each piece of data. One serves for uploading and editing, and the other - for viewing.</p>

<p>Once collage is created, it will be visible with its assignd name in the Dashboard, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/6.png" alt="Collage creation" width="200"></p>

<p>When one clicks on this sign, the empty page with the name of the collage opens:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/7.png" alt="Collage creation" width="400"></p>

<h2>Creating project title and a short description</h2>
<p>The user can proceed with setting up of the first page of the project. This page will contain the title of the project and a brief description.</p>

<p>There are two applications in INSERI that allow to do it:</p>

<p>Text Editor, where the text is typeset and
Plaintext Viewer, the app which displays the result on the webpage.</p>

<p>Lets first start with the Text Editor:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8.png" alt="Collage creation" width="600"></p>

<p>Here are the two applications together:

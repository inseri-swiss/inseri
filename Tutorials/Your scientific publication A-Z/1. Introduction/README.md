# 0.Introduction

In the end of this tutorial, the user will have and idea about the workflow areas in INSERI.

<p>This is a collection of tutorials that will allow the scholar to start and successfully finish their academic project from A to Z within INSERI framework.</p>

<p>The whole workflow is divided into 7 distinct areas, as below. The project might need all 7 or only a few. These areas conceived in such a way as to cover the totality of the academic work, from raw data collection to analysis, and, finally, to publication. The framework should be sufficient for the scholar to have all the project data in a single place, and to need no other applications to be able to complete the project.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/1.png" alt="7 project areas" width="500"></p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Add&quot;</strong> part covers the workflow from the raw data upload, via adding metadata, managing bibliography, to the formulation of hypothesis and methods. Some parts are already stable in INSERI, others are under development.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Admin&quot;</strong> part covers various aspects of administering the project, it is UNDER DEVELOPMENT, and will include such tools as adding users, project planning, a selection of online communication tools, etc.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Enrich&quot;</strong> part essecially covers various kids of TEI/XML tagging and annotation of the raw data, which becomes transformed into texts and numbers. The information is saved as triples.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Analyse&quot;</strong> block consists of various tools made for human and computer-assisted analysis, such as the comparison of two or more images, text versions comparison, finding textual parallels, colliding variants in a view to produce a diplomatic/critical edition.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Visual&quot;</strong> part is already well-developed in INSERI, which has not less than 8 different visualization applications, all of them can directly reuse the RDF data created at the previous steps.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;SWT&quot;</strong> part stands for &quot;Semantic Web Technology&quot;, and this module offers the scholars the possibility to formulate very complex queries, that are beyond the capacities provided by complex search queries in relational databases, for example.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>&quot;Publish&quot;</strong> area provides various options for generating the output that can be immediately used for producing online or print books and articles.</li>

<h1 id="toc_0">Creating your academic project</h1>
<h3 id="toc_0">Step 0.1: Login, setting up project "space", creating project title and a short description.</h3>

<h2>Login</h2>
<p>The users can already create their project page in INSERI, describe it, obtain and change the access information, as well as add the texts, tables, and pictures. </p>

<p>To get started, one should access INSERI here:
<a href="http://test-nieos.nie-ine.ch/home">Inseri Test Version</a>
[Inseri Prod Version] Only prod version allows creating an account.</p>

<p>By clicking on the lighthouse image in the top left corner, one opens a list of applications, as below.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/2.png" alt="Applications, state 2020.03.24" width="600"></p>

<p>Clicking on "Log in" in Inseri Test version opens the login form, which is here:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/3.png" alt="Login, state 2020.03.24" width="300"></p>

<h2>Setting up project "space"</h2>
<p>Having logged in, first of all, the user should create a &quot;project space&quot;. For that, in the Dashboard, which opens in INSERI from the top right-hand corner, and, in order to do this, one should click on the green button, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/4.png" alt="Create New" width="200"></p>

<p>It will open a frame for creating a new &quot;Collage&quot;, which the user should imagine as a separate webpage, which will contain multiple elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5.png" alt="Collage creation" width="400"></p>

<p>The information set in here won&#39;t be visible to public, but only to the creator and the members of the groups that are set (more on groupd in the Admin section below). What is being created here is a &quot;storage&quot; that will contain finished and unfinished parts of the online project, that are not visible to public until they are &quot;published&quot;. 
Another important point, is that there often (but not always) 2 applications for entering each piece of data. One serves for uploading and editing, and the other - for viewing.</p>

<p>Once collage is created, it will be visible with its assignd name in the Dashboard, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/6.png" alt="Collage creation" width="200"></p>

<p>When one clicks on this sign, the empty page with the name of the collage opens:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/7.png" alt="Collage creation" width="400"></p>

<h2>Creating project title and a short description</h2>
<p>The user can proceed with setting up of the first page of the project. This page will contain the title of the project and a brief description.</p>

<p>There are two applications in INSERI that allow to do it:</p>

<p>Text Editor, where the text is typeset and
Plaintext Viewer, the app which displays the result on the webpage.</p>

<p>Lets first start with the Text Editor:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8.png" alt="Collage creation" width="600"></p>

<p>This application allows creating and modifying a project webpage in a very simple way. 
There are 4 major areas in the app:</p>

<ol>
<li>Editor</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Output</li>
<li>Export</li>
</ol>

<p>In the <strong>Editor</strong> one can enter the text, select what degree of highlights (i.e. size, color, background) the text should have; align the text, include the images (upload from desktop is possible and easy), and set up a link to another page, via a link sign.
The saving is not automatical, and one need to click on the &quot;Save&quot; button down the page often.
The <strong>Code</strong> area shows all typed and set up in the editor in HTML. This code can be conveniently copied and pasted to any other webpage editor, and is used to visualize the result in the set of &quot;viewer&quot; applications.
The <strong>Output</strong> should show the result in real time, how it will be visible to the outside viewers.
The <strong>Export</strong> area [has another Save button, export options are UNDER DEVELOPMENT].</p>

<p>Once the user has clicked the &quot;Save&quot; button, and (depending on the Internet connection issues) reloaded the page, the file has been saved in the INSERI file storage [may be precise here the size limit issues?]</p>

<p>This file can now be called from other applications. Let us take an example of the Text Viewer. The user should, all like before, from the same &quot;Project&quot; page, click in the &quot;Lighthouse&quot; button, and select the &quot;Plaintext Viewer&quot; from the list.</p>

<p>It opens as a seemingly empty frame, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8a.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer" width="300"></p>

<p>In order to generate the view of the text that the user has just entered, all we need is to recall the file. For that, the user should click on the texts &quot;Plain text viewer&quot; itself, and it will open an &quot;options&quot; menu, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8b.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer Options" width="200"></p>

<p>Let us briefly go through all the options, because the same exist in the absolute majority of the INSERI applications.</p>

<p>The options include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change Title and Size</li>
<li>File Options</li>
<li>Minimize</li>
<li>Close</li>
</ol>

<p>We shall describe here only the first 2, the other being self-evident.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Change Title and Size&quot;</strong> opens the following option window:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8c.png" alt="Plaintext Editor and Plaintext Viewer" width="500"></p>

<p>What we are setting up here is the size of the textual block that we have just entered in the &quot;Text Editor&quot; how it will be visible to public in the &quot;Viewer&quot;.
We can create a &quot;Tile&quot; covering only a part of the visible screen, or to make the text occupy the whole screen. More over, the user can also change the headline, holding the name of the application, i.e. &quot;Plaintext Viewer&quot; into something different, or even delete it altogether. &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Close&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;File Options&quot;</strong> shall open another menu, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8d.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer File Options" width="400"></p>

<p>What we need is the &quot;Option for input: &quot;textlist&quot;&quot;. 
It will open the following possiblities:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8e.png" alt="Further Options" width="200"></p>

<p>&quot;Change current data&quot; will open JSON object, which can be modified by hand.
&quot;Open other file&quot;, will open a directory with INSERI where the Project files are stored.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8f.png" alt="INSERI file directory" width="500"></p>

<p>All we need is to select the file we have just created (most recent are up by default), and click on &quot;+&quot; sign. By doing so we have have created a link between the file done in &quot;Editor&quot; and its visualization in the &quot;Viewer&quot;. Having clicked on &quot;+&quot; we shall be back to a form we have seen already, click on &quot;Close and reload page to see changes&quot; in order to validate the established link:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8d.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer File Options" width="700"></p>

<p>Other options from the area above include:
&quot;Create new file&quot; with do create a new file, that can be further opened in the &quot;Text editor&quot; as we have done above in another direction, i.e. from &quot;Editor&quot; to &quot;Viewer&quot;.
&quot;Assign to query&quot; shall be dealt with further down.</p>

<p>Here are the two applications together:
<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/9.png" alt="Plaintext Editor and Plaintext Viewer" width="1000"></p></p>

Having created and viewed the Title and brief description of the Project, we shall learn next how to upload primary data, starting with images. TO BE CONTINUED....

# 5. Data Visualisations
## 5.1. Apps already existing in Inseri

Data visualisation is a very important aspect of the academic data presentation, and it allows the reader grasping the logic of the presentation in a matter of seconds. 
For the scholar, this block is of importance because visualisation helps in all of the 7 areas of academic work listed in the introduction. For example,

1. It allows to control raw data, for example, "how many images from Japan from 2005 do I have?"
2. It allows to correct the metadata, as the faults become visible.
3. It is the most basic tool helping the comparison of the data subsets.
4. The visualisation of the data model and the SWT results can even lead to the unexpected academic discoveries.
5. Finally, it helps the reader to understand the data.

There is a multitude of applications to visualise data that have been already incorporated into Inseri and are stable.
Let us make a list of them and explore them one by one via modifying data in JSON. (Other options, such as direct addressing the RDF data and the desktop upload are under development.)
The applications that can be used as per 2020.03.31 include:
				
1. Bar Chart 	d3.js, interactive			
2. Line Chart 	d3.js, interactive		
3. Pie Chart 	d3.js, data visualisation
4. Radial Bar Chart 	d3.js, data visualisation
5. Sankey 	d3.js, data visualisation	
6. Stacked Bar Chart 	d3.js, data visualisation
7. Chord diagram 	d3.js, data visualisation

### 5.1.1. Bar Chart 
This visualisation format fits best to visualize the simpliest data sets, which are unform and flat. For example, we have collected images from many different countries, and we would like to see how many images do we have per each country. 
(If we would need to add the year of collect, or the gender of the author of the image, for example, the Salcked Bar Chart is more appropriate.)

Click on the "Lighthouse" and select Bar Chart from the list of applications.
It will open a form with a predefined visualisation, which is very useful as the beginners can modify it directly.

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.01.png" alt="Preconfigured Bar Chart upon opening of the app" width="500"></p>

Following the same procedure as we learn in O. Introduction, the user should click on the name of the application to access the options. What we need, is an option for Input data.

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.02.png" alt="Bar Chart input data options" width="500"></p>

Within that frame, the user should select "Change current data". Other options shall be explained later, i.e. for queries, there will be a special block of Tutorials.

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.03.png" alt="Bar Chart input data options 2" width="200"></p>

A new frame will open, which includes the file name (as in Inseri storage), date of modification, and the server URL. The user should click on "Get JSON object".

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.04.png" alt="Accessing JSON" width="500"></p>

In the empty frame a modifiable JSON code appears.
<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.05.png" alt="Accessing JSON 2" width="500"></p>

Suppose we need to add some real project data, for that we shall use (with Project permission) the data of the "Drawings of Gods" project, from the University of Lausanne, state 2020.03.31, and that data is from [www.ddd.unil.ch]()

We shall create a Bar Chart representing visually how many images were collected in each country, and the data is a follows:

1. Argentina, 82 images
2. Brazil, 139 images
3. Iran, 3032 images
4. Japan, 142 images
5. Nepal, 13 images
6. Netherlands, 195 images
7. Romania, 756 images
8. Russia, 753 images
9. Switzerland, 1031 images
10. USA, 982 images

In order to do that, we need to do 3 things:

* update the number of columns, by copy-pasting the part of code for a single column.
* we need to update the labels, by replacing the "first bar", etc. with a name of the country.
* Finally, we need to update the values with the real numbers of images.

The modified part of Json is now as follows:

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.06.png" alt="Modified JSON" width="500"></p>

Before closing, it is an absolute must to click on "Save and update Json object."

Having clicked on save and reload, we obtain the following result:
<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.07.png" alt="Number of images per country" width="900"></p>

Finally, the user can try to find better scale options by simply modifying the number in Scale. And to rename the whole, so it is not called a "Bar Chart". In order to to this, the user should click on the "Bar Chart", and select the first option "Title and size", and simple type the new name and save it.

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.08.png" alt="Options frame with the Bar Chart as name selected" width="900"></p>

Resulting name modification:
<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5V.09.png" alt="Name of Bar Chart modified" width="900"></p>

## 5.2. Apps which are external, but useful

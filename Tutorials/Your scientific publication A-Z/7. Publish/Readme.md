# 7. Publish
## 7.1. Publish your project webpage

We shall now explain how to connect the already made collages into a webpage with navigation and how to publish it with various options.

First of all, the user should decide how each page already created should look like, that is if the Inseri button, or application control frames should be visible or not, shall the user see only a resulting representation from an app, or also an app itself or not.

In order to remove an app from a collage one should click on the title, where there is an option "minimize".

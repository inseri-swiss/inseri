# 0. Introduction

In the end of this tutorial, the user will have an idea about the workflow areas in INSERI.

<p>This is a collection of tutorials that will allow the scholar to start and successfully finish their academic project from A to Z within INSERI framework.</p>

<p>The whole workflow is divided into 7 distinct areas, as below. The project might need all 7 or only a few. These areas conceived in such a way as to cover the totality of the academic work, from raw data collection to analysis, and, finally, to publication. The framework should be sufficient for the scholar to have all the project data in a single place, and to need no other applications to be able to complete the project.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/1.png" alt="7 project areas" width="500"></p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Add&quot;</strong> part covers the workflow from the raw data upload, via adding metadata, managing bibliography, to the formulation of hypothesis and methods. Some parts are already stable in INSERI, others are under development.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Admin&quot;</strong> part covers various aspects of administering the project, it is UNDER DEVELOPMENT, and will include such tools as adding users, project planning, a selection of online communication tools, etc.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Enrich&quot;</strong> part covers various kids of TEI/XML tagging and annotation of the raw data, which becomes transformed into text and numbers. The information can saved as triples.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Analyse&quot;</strong> block consists of various tools made for human and computer-assisted analysis, such as the comparison of two or more images, text versions comparison, finding textual parallels, colliding variants in a view to produce a diplomatic/critical edition.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;Visual&quot;</strong> part is already well-developed in INSERI, which has not less than 8 different visualization applications, all of them can directly reuse the RDF data created at the previous steps.</li>
<li>The <strong>&quot;SWT&quot;</strong> part stands for &quot;Semantic Web Technology&quot;, and this module offers the scholars the possibility to formulate very complex queries, that are beyond the capacities provided by complex search queries in relational databases, for example.</li>
<li>Finally, the <strong>&quot;Publish&quot;</strong> area provides various options for generating the output that can be immediately used for producing online or print books and articles.</li>

<h2>0.1.1. Login</h2>
<p>The users can immediately create their project page in INSERI, describe it, obtain and change the access information, as well as add the texts, tables, and pictures. </p>

<p>To get started, one should access INSERI here:
<a href="http://test-nieos.nie-ine.ch/home">Inseri Test Version</a>
[Inseri Prod Version] Only prod version allows creating an account.</p>

<p>By clicking on the lighthouse image in the top left corner, one opens a list of applications, as below.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/2.png" alt="Applications, state 2020.03.24" width="600"></p>

<p>Clicking on "Log in" in Inseri Test version opens the login form, which is here:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/3.png" alt="Login, state 2020.03.24" width="300"></p>

<h2>0.1.2. Setting up project "space"</h2>
<p>Having logged in, first of all, the user should create a &quot;project space&quot;. For that, in the Dashboard, which opens in INSERI from the top right-hand corner,  one should click on the green button, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/4.png" alt="Create New" width="200"></p>

<p>It will open a frame for creating a new &quot;Collage&quot;, which the user should imagine as a separate webpage, which will contain multiple elements, i.e. pages.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/5.png" alt="Collage creation" width="400"></p>

<p>The information set in here won&#39;t be visible to public, but only to the creator and the members of the groups that are set (
more on groups in the Admin section below). What is being created here is a &quot;storage&quot; that will contain finished and unfinished parts of the online project, that are not visible to public until they are &quot;published&quot;. 
Another important point, is that there are often (but not always) two applications for entering each piece of data. One serves for uploading and editing, and the other - for viewing.</p>

<p>Once collage is created, it will be visible with its assigned name in the Dashboard, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/6.png" alt="Collage creation" width="200"></p>

<p>When one clicks on this sign, the empty page with the name of the collage opens:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/7.png" alt="Collage creation" width="400"></p>

<h2>0.1.3. Creating project title and a short description</h2>
<p>The user can proceed with setting up of the first page of the project. This page will contain the title of the project and a brief description.</p>

<p>There are two applications in INSERI that allow to do it:</p>

<p>Text Editor, where the text is typeset and
Plaintext Viewer, the app which displays the result on the webpage.</p>

<p>Lets first start with the Text Editor:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8.png" alt="Collage creation" width="600"></p>

<p>This application allows creating and modifying a project webpage in a very simple way. 
There are 4 major areas in the app:</p>

<ol>
<li>Editor</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Output</li>
<li>Export</li>
</ol>

<p>In the <strong>Editor</strong> one can enter the text, select what degree of highlights (i.e. size, colour, background) the text should have; align the text, include the images (upload from desktop is possible and easy), and set up a link to another page, via a link sign.
The saving is not automatic, and one need to click on the &quot;Save&quot; button down the page often.
The <strong>Code</strong> area shows all typed and set up in the editor in HTML. This code can be conveniently copied and pasted to any other webpage editor, and is used to visualize the result in the set of &quot;viewer&quot; applications.
The <strong>Output</strong> should show the result in real time, how it will be visible to the outside viewers.
The <strong>Export</strong> area [has another Save button, export options are UNDER DEVELOPMENT].</p>

<p>Once the user has clicked the &quot;Save&quot; button, and (depending on the Internet connection issues) reloaded the page, the file has been saved in the INSERI file storage [may be precise here the size limit issues?]</p>

<p>This file can now be called from other applications. Let us take an example of the Text Viewer. The user should, all like before, from the same &quot;Project&quot; page, click in the &quot;Lighthouse&quot; button, and select the &quot;Plaintext Viewer&quot; from the list.</p>

<p>It opens as a seemingly empty frame, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8a.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer" width="300"></p>

<p>In order to generate the view of the text that the user has just entered, all we need is to recall the file. For that, the user should click on the text &quot;Plain text viewer&quot; itself, and it will open the &quot;options&quot; menu, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8b.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer Options" width="200"></p>

<p>Let us briefly go through all the options, because the same exist in the absolute majority of the INSERI applications.</p>

<p>The options include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change Title and Size</li>
<li>File Options</li>
<li>Minimize</li>
<li>Close</li>
</ol>

<p>We shall describe here only the first two, the other being self-evident.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Change Title and Size&quot;</strong> opens the following option window:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8c.png" alt="Plaintext Editor and Plaintext Viewer" width="500"></p>

<p>What we are setting up here is the size of the textual block that we have just entered in the &quot;Text Editor&quot; how it will be visible to public in the &quot;Viewer&quot;.
We can create a &quot;Tile&quot; covering only a part of the visible screen, or to make the text occupy the whole screen. More over, the user can also change the headline, here containing the name of the application, i.e. &quot;Plaintext Viewer&quot; into something different, or even delete it altogether. &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Close&quot;.</p>

<p>In June 2020 a new option has been added: the user can now not only change the title, but also add a commentary, describing, for example, how the data was collected in the visualisation applications, or simply describing how to use the application for a given project.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;File Options&quot;</strong> shall open another menu, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8d.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer File Options" width="400"></p>

<p>What we need is the &quot;Option for input: &quot;textlist&quot;&quot;. 
It will open the following possibilities:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8e.png" alt="Further Options" width="200"></p>

<p>&quot;Change current data&quot; will open JSON object, which can be modified by hand.
&quot;Open other file&quot;, will open a directory within INSERI where the Project files are stored.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8f.png" alt="INSERI file directory" width="500"></p>

<p>All we need is to select the file we have just created (most recent are up by default), and click on &quot;+&quot; sign. By doing so we have created a link between the file done in the &quot;Editor&quot; and its visualization in the &quot;Viewer&quot;. Having clicked on &quot;+&quot; we shall be back to a form we have seen already, click on &quot;Close and reload page to see changes&quot; in order to validate the established link:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8d.png" alt="Plaintext Viewer File Options" width="700"></p>

<p>Other options from the area above include:
&quot;Create new file&quot; will create a new file, that can be further opened in the &quot;Text editor&quot; as we have done above in another direction, i.e. from &quot;Editor&quot; to &quot;Viewer&quot;.
&quot;Assign to query&quot; shall be dealt with further down.</p>

<p>Here are the two applications together:
<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/9.png" alt="Plaintext Editor and Plaintext Viewer" width="1000"></p></p>

As some pieces of information, such as title of the project and its description can occur in many different places, Inseri allows to modify/update them all centrally, i.e from one "Editor" to miltiple "Views".

Having created and viewed the Title and brief description of the Project, we shall learn next how to upload primary data, starting with images in the part called "Add Data".

<h2>0.1.4. Layout options</h2>

There are are two basic page layout options. One is a "natural" one, in which the applications windows will have shape and size as set by the user, example below:

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/0.%20Introduction/LV1.png" alt="Natural layout" width="800"></p>

The second option is called "Windows or tiles" and it can be accessed from the "options" button in the top righthand corner:

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/0.%20Introduction/LV2.png" alt="Windows/tiles button" width="300"></p>

When one clicks on the "windows/tiles", the page is rearranged in the following manner: the images are shown in full, the smaller applications windows are rearranged to fit better the screen, and there is a same-size space between all application windows.

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/0.%20Introduction/LV3.png" alt="Image with zoom in Windows mode" width="700"></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/0.%20Introduction/LV4.png" alt="Smaller applications in Windows mode" width="700"></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/0.%20Introduction/LV5.png" alt="Image Viewer in Windows mode" width="700"></p>

If you resize manually the browser window size, the applications will rearrange themselves automatically on the page again, to fit it, thus providing the best viewing option regardless of support (phone/pad/computer).

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-04/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/0.%20Introduction/LV6.png" alt="Reduced browser window in Windows mode" width="700"></p>

<h2>0.1.5. Applications in Inseri</h2>
Since June 2020, the applications in Inseri are arranged into the categories following the logic of the major steps within a research project. These steps have been outlined above, at the beginning of the Introduction. Here we shall simply bring together the steps and a group or groups of applications, because the scholars and the developers arrange data following slightly different logic.

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-06/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/0.%20Introduction/LV7.png" alt="Logic of Inseri Applications" width="700"></p>

<p>The Admin group is self-explantory.</p>
<p>The "Add" and "Enrich" steps have two linked groups of applications, in which WebApps, linked to the step "Add" allow to play the web content or address the data from the existing webpages. The templates for adressing E-codices or KNORA are further to be found here.
Group of applications called "Add, Enrich and manage Data" is linked to to both steps "Add" and "Enrich", and it includes uploading files from the desktop, commenting upon them, tagging and working with spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Various kinds of Data analysis, including SWT and Machine Reasoning sessions will be possible to do "live" via "Microservices" group of applications.</p>
<p>The results of "Analysis" can be directly visualised in "Visualise" group, including some 19 apps.</p>
<p>The "Publish" step with a corresponding group of applications enables the  Web publishing, with other kinds of output being under development.</p>

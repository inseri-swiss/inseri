## Plaintext Viewer

<p>There are two applications in INSERI that allow the user to add the text:</p>

<p>Text Editor, where the text is typeset and
Plaintext Viewer, the app which displays the result on the webpage.</p>

<p>Lets first start with the Text Editor:</p>

<p>In the <strong>Editor</strong> one can enter the text, select what degree of highlights (i.e. size, colour, background) the text should have; align the text, include the images (upload from desktop is possible and easy), and set up a link to another page, via a link sign.
  
The saving is not automatic, and one needs to click on the &quot;Save Text and Update Page&quot; button down the page often.

The <strong>Code</strong> area shows all typed and set up in the editor in HTML.

This code can be conveniently copied and pasted to any other webpage editor, and is used to visualize the result in the set of &quot;viewer&quot; applications.


The <strong>Output</strong> down the editor should show the result in real time, how it will be visible to the outside viewers.

<p>Once the user has clicked the &quot;Save&quot; button, and then on Inseri Logo, the file is saved and can now be called from other applications. Let us take an example of the Text Viewer. The user should, all like before, from the same &quot;Project&quot; page, click in the &quot;Lighthouse&quot; button, and select the &quot;Plaintext Viewer&quot; from the list.</p>

<p>It opens as a seemingly empty frame, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-10/Tutorials/App%20descriptions%20for%20Researchers/Apps%20to%20visualise%20data/Plaintext%20Viewer/2.5VE.png" alt="TextEditor" width="400"></p>

<p>In order to generate the view of the text that the user has just entered, all we need is to recall the file. For that, the user should click on the text &quot;Plain text viewer&quot; itself, and it will open the &quot;options&quot; menu, as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-10/Tutorials/App%20descriptions%20for%20Researchers/Apps%20to%20visualise%20data/Plaintext%20Viewer/2.8VE.png" alt="PlainTextViewerOptions" width="400"></p>

<p>Let us briefly go through all the options, because the same exist in the absolute majority of the INSERI applications.</p>

<p>The options include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change Title and Size</li>
<li>Change app description</li>
<li>Move app on page</li>
<li>App Input Options</li>
<li>Data Management</li>
<li>Minimise</li>
<li>Close</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>&quot;Change Title and Size&quot;</strong> opens the following option window:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-03/Tutorials/Your%20scientific%20publication%20A-Z/1.%20Introduction/8c.png" alt="Plaintext Editor and Plaintext Viewer" width="500"></p>

<p>What we are setting up here is the size of the textual block that we have just entered in the &quot;Text Editor&quot; how it will be visible to public in the &quot;Viewer&quot;.
We can create a &quot;Tile&quot; covering only a part of the visible screen, or to make the text occupy the whole screen. More over, the user can also change the headline, here containing the name of the application, i.e. &quot;Plaintext Viewer&quot; into something different, or even delete it altogether. &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Close&quot;.</p>

<p>In June 2020 a new option has been added, <strong>&quot;Change App Description&quot;</strong>: the user can now not only change the title, but also add a commentary, describing, for example, how the data was collected in the visualisation applications, or simply describing how to use the application for a given project.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Move App on Page&quot;</strong>, will show the arrows to the left and right that will allow to move the app in question up and down.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;App Input Options&quot;</strong> shall open another menu, where we should select "textlist", to access further options as below:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/nie-ine/inseri/blob/2020-10/Tutorials/App%20descriptions%20for%20Researchers/Apps%20to%20visualise%20data/Plaintext%20Viewer/AIO.png" alt="PlainTextViewerOptions" width="400"></p>

Here we can "Change Current Data" by directly editing JSON, or we can create a new file, for example, by pasting a created in the Editor code, or we can assign a file to a query (These options shall be explained separately.)

&quot;Open other file&quot;, will open a directory within INSERI where the Project files are stored. (This option does not exist as of Oct. 2020, but it previously allowed to save a text file in from the Text Editor and to call that text file from the PlainText Viewer.)</p>

Having passed through these options, let us come back to the linking Text Editor and Plaintext Viewer, that we shall do here via <strong>&quot;Data Management&quot;</strong>.
